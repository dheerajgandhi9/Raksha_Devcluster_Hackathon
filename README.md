Raksha (Women Safety WebService)

Idea behind project

Women in our country, especially women who travel alone face alot of problems.
They have to travel with the constant fear of being mugged and sexual assault, especially at night .
So what if we provide a tool that helps women to travel more safely and is with them 24/7 ?
The main idea behind our project is to provide a web-service that helps women to move around safely 
and get help in any emergency without delay due to location unavailability.
It also provides additional information whether a particular area is safe or not depending upon
the no. of reports registered in that area.
